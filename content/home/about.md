# Biography

I am a PhD student in computer science with Dietrich Klakow in the Spoken Language Systems Group at Saarland University. 

My research is concerned with multimodal machine learning in the field of natural language processing (NLP). In more details, my research focus is on extending neural language models by leveraging (un)structured and semi-structured knowledge representations.

Further, I am interested in adversarial machine learning and its applications for interpreting machine learning models.

I am a member of the SFB 1102 founded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) working in project B4 on [Modeling and Measuring Information Density](http://www.sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/?page_id=284).
